    detail: `I'm a developer and final-year mechanical engineering student who discovered his true interest in programming. I've always been fascinated by how computers and mobile applications respond to commands. During my first semester, I learnt about programming and began teaching myself how to code. After a few weeks, I realised that this is what I wanted to pursue with my life, and I fell in love with the beauty of programming. It requires a blend of creative and logical problem-solving abilities, and there is always something new to learn.`,
